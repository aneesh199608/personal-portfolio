<![CDATA[
This file defines memory for `index.html` in a browser-rendered project.

- Do not insert `<![CDATA[` or any AI-specific markup into `index.html`.
- This file is executed by the browser, so only valid HTML should be present.
- Avoid inserting `<script>` tags or memory blocks directly into this file.
- Navigation or dynamic content should be handled via imported JS (`script.js`).
- Theme toggles, project sections, and hero sections are statically defined here.

Memory, context, and assistant instructions should be kept in this `.memory.md` file or `.cline.md`.
