This file defines memory for `script.js` which is included in a live website.

- Do not include CDATA tags or memory wrapping inside the actual `script.js` file.
- This JS is executed directly by the browser and must remain valid JavaScript.
- Any AI agent should reference this `.memory.md` file instead of injecting into JS.
- Theme toggling, DOM manipulation, or component loading should be handled cleanly.

Keep the actual JS file focused on browser-safe logic.
