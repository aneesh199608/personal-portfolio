# Active Context (Updated)

This file tracks the current focus, recent changes, and the state of key files.

**Current Focus:** Finalized Webpack bundling and deployment to GitHub Pages. Hero.js has been removed. Memory now lives in the six core context files.

**Recent Changes:**
- Removed `Hero.js` and its references in `script.js` and HTML.
- Refined `script.js` to only bind `themeToggle` and call `createNavbar` and `preloadProjectPages`.
- Webpack setup finalized:
  - `html-webpack-plugin` and `mini-css-extract-plugin` enabled.
  - Theme toggle and dynamic navbar injection now work consistently across pages.
  - Deploys via `gh-pages` to `gh-pages` branch.

**File Status Summaries:**

* `index.html` – Loads `#navbar-container` Linked through `html-webpack-plugin`.
* `about.html` – Reuses shared styles and navigation logic. Theme toggle works.
* `script.js` – Main orchestrator; imports `createNavbar`, `preloadProjectPages`, and binds theme toggle.
* `styles.css` – Base styling, theming with CSS variables.
* `Navbar.js` – Dynamically creates nav with theme toggle.
* `projects.js` – Preloads linked `.project-card-link` HTMLs.
* `webpack.config.mjs` – Outputs to `dist`, injects CSS/JS via plugins, supports SPA routing (`historyApiFallback`).
* `dist/` – Contains production `index.html`, `bundle.js`, and `main.css`.

**Next Steps:**
- Add actual content to about page and remaining projects.
- Implement full responsiveness testing.
- Expand random projects section.
