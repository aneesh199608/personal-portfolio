# Project Brief: Personal Portfolio Website

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Goal

Build a personal portfolio website to showcase skills and work as a **UI/UX Designer and Design Engineer**. The site should be hosted on GitHub Pages.

## ðŸ§  Core Philosophy (from .cline.md)

-   **Simplicity over complexity**: Write clean, readable, maintainable code.
-   **Iterate, donâ€™t rewrite**: Build upon existing structure unless a full redesign is needed.
-   **Stay scoped**: Work within the task. Avoid unrelated changes or scope creep.
-   **Support human-in-the-loop design**: Respect existing creative decisions while suggesting relevant design/UX improvements.

## Key Requirements

-   **Stack:** Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
-   **No Frameworks:** Avoid React, Tailwind, etc., unless explicitly requested.
-   **Buildless:** Should work without build tools or a backend.
-   **Theme:** Dark mode default, toggleable to light mode, with persistent theme preference.
-   **AI Behavior:**
    -   Reuse existing HTML structure when modifying UI.
    -   Add helpful comments where needed.
    -   Focus only on the current section/task.
    -   Donâ€™t rewrite full files unless requested.
    -   Donâ€™t introduce new design systems or libraries.
    -   Help write scalable, accessible, modular code.
    -   Suggest UX improvements only when relevant.
    -   Do not add CDATA or AI wrappers to HTML/JS files.
