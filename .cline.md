# Cline AI Project Prompt ‚Äì UI/UX Portfolio Website

## üß† Core Philosophy

- **Simplicity over complexity** ‚Äì Write clean, readable, maintainable code.
- **Iterate, don‚Äôt rewrite** ‚Äì Build upon existing structure unless a full redesign is needed.
- **Stay scoped** ‚Äì Work within the task. Avoid unrelated changes or scope creep.
- **Support human-in-the-loop design** ‚Äì I‚Äôm a designer who codes. Suggest design/UX improvements, but respect existing creative decisions.

## Project Context

You‚Äôre helping me build a portfolio website to showcase my skills as a **UI/UX Designer and Design Engineer**, hosted on GitHub Pages.

### Stack & Constraints

- Vanilla **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**
- No React, Tailwind, or frameworks unless explicitly requested
- Should work without build tools or a backend
- Dark mode default, toggleable to light mode, with persistent theme

### Page Sections

- Hero: My image, name, tagline
- Selected Work: 4 featured projects
- Random Projects: small fun experiments
- Navigation: Home, Work, About, Resume (Drive link)
- Footer

### AI Behavior Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Reuse existing HTML structure when modifying UI
- ‚úÖ Add helpful comments where needed
- ‚úÖ Focus only on the current section/task
- ‚ùå Don‚Äôt rewrite full files unless requested
- ‚ùå Don‚Äôt introduce new design systems or libraries
