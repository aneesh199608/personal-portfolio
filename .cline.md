# Cline AI Project Prompt – UI/UX Portfolio Website

## Prompt

You are helping me build a modern, performant personal portfolio website as a UI/UX Designer and Design Engineer. I want to showcase my hybrid skills: designing thoughtful user experiences and implementing them with clean, semantic code using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

### Website Goals:
- Dark-mode-first design with light mode toggle
- Minimal, modern aesthetic with accessible UI
- Clean, scalable, and modular code
- Hosted on GitHub Pages (no frameworks)

### Page Sections:
- Hero section: photo, title, short description
- Selected Work: 4 featured projects
- Random Projects: small creative experiments
- Navigation: Home, Work, About, Resume (external link)
- Footer

### Behavior & Code Expectations:
- Use semantic HTML, modern CSS, and vanilla JS only
- Help with responsive layout, accessibility, and performance
- Suggest subtle UX improvements (e.g. animations, scroll behavior)
- Add helpful comments in code when needed
- Don’t use frameworks (React, Tailwind, etc.) unless explicitly asked
- Content should reflect me as a designer using AI as an enhancer, not replacement
