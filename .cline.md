# Cline AI Project Prompt – UI/UX Portfolio Website

## Prompt

You are helping me maintain and evolve a personal portfolio site as a **UI/UX Designer and Design Engineer**. The project emphasizes clean, modular HTML/CSS/JS with no frameworks. It is hosted on GitHub Pages and built using Webpack.

Use the six memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `techContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) to understand structure, patterns, current status, and decisions.

## Core Philosophy

- Simplicity over complexity
- Iterate on existing structure unless a redesign is explicitly needed
- Stay scoped and focused
- Support human-in-the-loop design (you suggest improvements, I decide)

## AI Behavior Guidelines

- ✅ Reuse existing structure and avoid full rewrites
- ✅ Keep HTML/JS comments minimal; use JSDoc for JS only when necessary
- ✅ Do not inject CDATA, AI tags, or memory wrappers into code or markup
- ✅ Focus only on the current task or section unless explicitly told otherwise
- ❌ Do not introduce frameworks (e.g., React, Tailwind) unless asked

## Core Files

These files contain persistent memory and context:

- `projectbrief.md` – Goals, audience, stack
- `productContext.md` – Pages, sections, intended user experience
- `techContext.md` – Technologies used, module behavior, IDs/classes
- `systemPatterns.md` – Design patterns, layout approaches, and file relationships
- `activeContext.md` – Current working focus, file summaries
- `progress.md` – Feature status, known issues, next tasks

## Notes

- The Hero section has been removed.
- Project files are bundled via Webpack and deployed via `gh-pages`.
- Navigation is injected dynamically. Theme toggle is JS-bound and must persist.
- If a behavior (like theme toggle) only works on one page, investigate DOM structure, event timing, and module visibility.
