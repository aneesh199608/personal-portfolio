# Cline AI Project Prompt – UI/UX Portfolio Website

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

- **Simplicity over complexity** – Write clean, readable, maintainable code.
- **Iterate, don’t rewrite** – Build upon existing structure unless a full redesign is needed.
- **Stay scoped** – Work within the task. Avoid unrelated changes or scope creep.
- **Support human-in-the-loop design** – I’m a designer who codes. Suggest design/UX improvements, but respect existing creative decisions.

## Project Context

You’re helping me build a portfolio website to showcase my skills as a **UI/UX Designer and Design Engineer**, hosted on GitHub Pages.

### Stack & Constraints

- Vanilla **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**
- No React, Tailwind, or frameworks unless explicitly requested
- Should work without build tools or a backend
- Dark mode default, toggleable to light mode, with persistent theme

### Page Sections

- Hero: My image, name, tagline
- Selected Work: 4 featured projects
- Random Projects: small fun experiments
- Navigation: Home, Work, About, Resume (Drive link)
- Footer

### AI Behavior Guidelines

- ✅ Reuse existing HTML structure when modifying UI
- ✅ Minimize comments: Keep only essential header/documentation comments (e.g., JSDoc) in JS files. Remove all comments from CSS and HTML files unless specifically requested or necessary for complex logic.
- ✅ Focus only on the current section/task
- ❌ Don’t rewrite full files unless requested
- ❌ Don’t introduce new design systems or libraries
